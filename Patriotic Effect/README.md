# Patriotic Effect Filter 

*"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom."* 

We refer to our country as our motherland. She nurtures us and helps us grow. It is essential for one to possess the virtue of patriotism as it makes us better. 

With the help of this filter, I would like to give tribute to all the courageous soldiers who have been fighting on the borders, so that we can live peacefully, and all the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for us so as to protect our country.
